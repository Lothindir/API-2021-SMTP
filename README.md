## Introduction
The main goal of this project is to become familiar with the SMTP protocol. We were asked by our professor to develop a client application that plays pranks on a list of victims. This app will generate a number of pranks based on properties specified in a config file, a list of messages and a list of victims. Then, the app will communicate with a SMTP server in order to send the prank e-mail to the targeted victims.

As we don't want to disturb a live SMTP server, we will use a test server called MockMock. It will act as a normal server, let us look at the requests we make and check if our app works, but it won't dispatch the pranks to the real e-mail addresses.

## MockMock installation
The MockMock being used in this project is the following : [MockMock](https://github.com/HEIGVD-Course-API/MockMock)

First you need to open a terminal in the folder containing the provided DockerFile. Make sure you have docker installed and that the service is running.

```
# Check if the service is running
systemctl status docker.service

# Start the docker service in the current session
systemctl start docker.service

# To enable docker at boot
systemctl enable docker.service

```

Then, use `docker build -t mockmock .` to build an image named *mockmock*. This step might take a couple of minutes. You might need to use **sudo** for this command to work.

Once it's done, use `docker run -d  -p 25:25 -p 8282:8282 mockmock` to create a container running *mockmock* image and run it in detached mode. You can remove *-d* if you want to see it in your terminal. 
Now, go to your favorite browser and type `localhost:8282`, the MockMock web interface should appear.

When you're done using the container, kill it with `docker kill <container_id>`. You can see your container id with `docker ps -a`.

## Set up
Now that you have a MockMock server running in the background you start by configuring your app. This SMTP application contains three files : config.properties, messages.utf8, victims.utf8. In the first one you will find the following properties :
```java
smtpServerAddress=127.0.0.1
smtpServerPort=25
numberOfGroups=1
personToCC=bob.dylan@rock.ch, michael.jackson@thriller.com
```

Feel free to edit the properties. In the second file you will find two templates of message you could send. Each message starts with a subject line and ends with `----------------`. You can add as many messages as you like, the app will chose one randomly and assign it to a prank.
The last file contains the list of e-mail addresses. Be sure to have correctly formatted addresses otherwise the app won't work.
